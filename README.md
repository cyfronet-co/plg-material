# **plg-material**
`plg-material` is a custom MkDocs theme for PLGrid infrastructure markdown documentations.

The theme extends the [mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme. It is also configured with [MkDocs static i18n plugin](https://github.com/ultrabug/mkdocs-static-i18n).

# **Instalation guide**
To install **plg-material** just follow the instruction below.

1. Download the project as a ZIP package.
2. Unzip the package in your MkDocs project.
3. Add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:
    ```
    theme:
      name: material
      custom_dir: plg-material-main
      palette:
        scheme: plg-material-light

    extra_css:
      - assets/stylesheets/plg-material.css
    ```
    We also recommend changing the unzipped directory name and `custom_dir` value to `plg-material` for the ease of naming.
4. Configure other options in your `mkdocs.yml`. You may find next section useful if you are looking for addition features intruduced in our custom theme.

# **Features**
## **PLGrid favicon & logo**
To add PLGrid favicon or logo in header in your page you have to define it in your theme:
```
theme:
  favicon: images/favicon.png
  icon:
    logo: logo
```
However, you may skip the `favicon` option since `images/favicon.png` is its default value.

## **Dark & light modes**
In our theme we have defined two custom schemes:
- dark, i.e. `plg-material-dark`
- light, i.e. `plg-material-light`

To use either one in your project you have to define it in your `theme.palette` option, e.g.:
```
theme:
  palette: 
    scheme: plg-material-light
```
However, if you would like to switch between the modes you have to add the following code to your `mkdocs.yml`:
```
theme:
  palette:
    - media: "(prefers-color-scheme: light)" # light mode
      scheme: plg-material-light
      toggle:
        icon: material/weather-night
        name: Switch to dark mode
    - media: "(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" # dark mode
      scheme: plg-material-dark
      toggle:
        icon: material/weather-sunny
        name: Switch to light mode
```

## **PLGrid infrastructure sites**
To add PLGrid infrastucture sites to your footer you have to add `pymdownx.emoji` extension to you markdown extensions and define the directory with the icons:
```
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.emoji:
    emoji_index: !!python/name:materialx.emoji.twemoji
    emoji_generator: !!python/name:materialx.emoji.to_svg
    options:
      custom_icons:
        - plg-material/.icons
```

## **Multi-language copyright**
The [MkDocs static i18n plugin](https://github.com/ultrabug/mkdocs-static-i18n) does not allow to translate the `config.copyright` option. Therefore, you may leave the default copyright value as a fallback and define the translated copyrights in `config.extra`, e.g.:
```
copyright: Default copyright

extra:
  copyright:
    pl: "Polish copyright"
    en: "English copyright"
```
